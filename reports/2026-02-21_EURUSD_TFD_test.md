# TFD Weekend Breakdown Test — EURUSD (data up to 2026-02-21)

## 1) TFD rules used from your PDF
- "We kopen nooit op Weekly highs en we verkopen nooit op Weekly lows."
- Reverse-zone entry focus: **between Fib 61.8 and 100**.
- Fibonacci is a tool, not a standalone confirmation.
- Pattern confirmation required first (M/W, H&S, inverse H&S).

## 2) EURUSD reference data (daily)
Source: Stooq daily EURUSD feed.

- 2026-02-20: O 1.17716 / H 1.18074 / L 1.17441 / C 1.17860

Computed weekly range:
- Weekly high: **1.18744**
- Weekly low: **1.17422**
- Friday close: **1.17860**

## 3) TFD-style read for weekend planning
Context on Friday close:
- Price closed in the lower part of the week range (closer to low than high).
- Not exactly at weekly low (distance ~43.8 pips above 1.17422).
- So by TFD rule: avoid chasing sells into absolute weekly low; prefer sells on pullback OR buys only with confirmed reversal pattern.

## 4) Candidate setups for next week (plan, not signal)
### A) Sell continuation (preferred only on pullback)
- Idea: bearish continuation if price retraces into supply area and rejects.
- Watch zone: **1.1820 - 1.1865** (retest zone near prior week mid/upper structure).
- Confirmation needed: lower-timeframe rejection + bearish pattern.
- Invalidation: sustained break/acceptance above weekly high 1.18744.

### B) Buy reversal (counter-trend, only with strong confirmation)
- Idea: buy only if a clear reversal pattern forms near/around weekly low region.
- Watch zone: **1.1742 - 1.1728** (weekly low + nearby 20D low area).
- Confirmation needed: W / inverse H&S + strong displacement up.
- Invalidation: clean breakdown and acceptance below 1.1728.

## 5) Execution checklist (what I will run every Saturday)
For each FX pair:
1. Mark weekly high / weekly low (outer structure).
2. Determine weekly close location (upper/mid/lower third).
3. Mark nearest supply/demand zones.
4. Build two-sided scenario (continuation + reversal) with invalidation.
5. Grade setup quality (A/B/C).
6. Output one row in overview sheet + one detailed note block.
